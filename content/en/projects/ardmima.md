#project-name
MiMa

#body
After 28 years, the ARD midday magazine has moved from Munich to Berlin and now broadcasts from the ZDF television studios Unter der Linden.

#sub
We developed a sample and broadcast concept for the three video walls in the television studio, including preview functionalities and user-friendly operation for the newsroom. Everything was implemented in just three weeks, and we are delighted with the successful broadcast launch from the heart of Berlin.
